Like a wrench, or a power drill, or a hammer, AI is but a tool.

<Image src={handyman} alt="a wise handyman" />

Years ago, a factory owner was forced to shut down production when a critical piece of machinery would not start. Every minute of downtime cost the factory thousands of dollars in lost revenue.

The factory engineer, and the foreman were stumped. In desperation, the owner turned to the factory's recently retired handyman for help.

He listened to the engineerâ€™s description of the problem and asked a few questions.

He looked at the mass of twisting conduit, listened to the thump and grind of internal gears, and felt the vibrations with his hands. 

He hummed to himself, reached into his toolbox and retrieved a small hammer.

He tapped on the gearbox one time. And, immediately, the entire factory line roared to life. The handyman went home.

Days later, the factory owner received a bill from the handyman for $5000.

The owner was incredulous and demanded an itemized invoice. The entire "repair" took less than 15 minutes.

This is what he received:

|Description                   |Cost     |
|------------------------------|-------: |
|Labor and Tools: Hammer (x1)  |    $5.00|
|Knowing where to tap          |$4,995.00|
|Total                         |$5,000.00|

The owner happily paid.

AI tools are the hammer. ***A very heavy hammer.***
But, without the knowledge to deploy it properly, knowing which questions to ask, *knowing where to tap*, you're only making noise.

Stop worrying about AI, and start worrying about being an expert in your field.
